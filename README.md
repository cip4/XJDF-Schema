# XJDF Schema (JDF 2.0)
All XJDF Schema Versions are available at https://schema.cip4.org  
  


## Development Notes
### Release a new Version
A new XJDF Schema version can be created and published by the creation of a new branch "release/JDF_2.x".

## Samples
The repository is responsible for maintaining XJDF samples. 
The build process validates these samples thereby ensuring any changes to the 
XJDF.xsd and/or samples remain in synch.
Furthermore each sample may contain multiple
 <!-- START SNIPPET -->
 <!-- END SNIPPET -->
pairs. The code between the START/END pair is exported in a file in rtf format.
These are uploaded (as part of the automatic build) to the 'JDF Specification' documentation 
repository which uses them to inline examples into the main specification.
